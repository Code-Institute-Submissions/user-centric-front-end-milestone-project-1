# User Centric Front End Development Milestone Project

Responsive website of the band the MONKEES.

# ux

The webiste is designed for the bands fans and newcomers. They wanted to make sure that their fans had a place 
online where they could listen to the bands music and watch a clip. 
The MONKEES members also wanted to use their website to showcase their talent to potential clients so that they
can get hired for birthdays, christmas parties and other events.

The goal of this project was to keep it simple for the user so, i developed the website with that goal in mind.

Fans, newcomers and potential clients have easy access to the websites content. There is a navigation bar that gives them four options: 

* Home: A welcome message from the band and an introduction of each memeber of the group for newcomers and clients
* Music: The music page where they can listen to the bands music. Each track has a cover picture
* Clip: The videoclip page where they can watch the band perform there music
* HIRE US!: This page has all the information necessary for clients to contact the band. It has an adrress bar with contact information
and social media links (which you will find on every page as well in the footer section) to their pages and youtube channel.

# Features 

The features of the website are very basic:
* Each link in the navigation bar allows the user to go on the page he wishes to visit.
* Social Media links in the footer allow the user to visit the bands facebook, twitter and youtube page. 
* There is a wikipedia link at the end of each introduction article so the newcomers and clients can read in more detail about the band.
* The HIRE US! Page allows the user to have all the contact information of the band so they can hire them for events.
* The HIRE US! Page has also links to Social Media account but this time on the page itself and not in the footer so the user can access it more easy.
